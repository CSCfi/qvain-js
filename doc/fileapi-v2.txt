1) Browse files by project and file path

In addition to browsing files by directory identifier like:

/directories/pid/files

it is now possible to browse by a known project identifier and file path, such as:

/directories/files?project=myproject&path=/some/path/here

2) More optional query parameters to file browsing:

depth=(int|*), control depth when combined with the parameter "recursive"

dirs_only=bool, omit files entirely from the result set. Combine with recursive=true, to get a directory tree.

include_parent=bool, includes the 'parent directory' of the contents being fetched in the results also. Example:
GET /directories/3/files?include_parent=true also includes data about directory id: 3 in the results.
otherwise, one would query for its data separately by GET /directories/3.

3) Optional parameter atomic=bool for bulk create/update operations. Specifying the flag will cause all changes to get rolled back if even one operation failed.
