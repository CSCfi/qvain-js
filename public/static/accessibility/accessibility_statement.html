            The Service in overall has a good contrast in main texts and
            features.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Some of the navigation links, buttons, icons and info texts do not
            have a contrast big enough to fully fulfill the accessibility
            requirements. The contrast varies between 1.5 - 4, most of them
            being ~3. The info texts have the lowest contrast (1.5).

            A lot of effort has been put to increase the contrast throughout
            the Service but in the mentioned features the change would have
            made the overall feel and look of the UI full and not easy to
            understand. Different alternatives for increasing the contrasts
            higher are under investigation but the schedule has not yet been
            agreed as the change is not trivial.

            Publication errors are a bit verbose for the users. For example,
            for missing mandatory fields the produced error message is really
            long and the user needs to read it very carefully to find out,
            amongst technical looking terms, the missing fields name.

            Do some parsing for Metax publication errors and show a simplified
            error for the user. Not a trivial task to do (as itâ€™s also
            technically hard to find the relevant information from the long
            system based error message) but needs to be planned and
            implemented.

</ul>

    Features will be fixed in the future. CSC service desk can help accessing
    the information/functionality and offers support by phone and email.
