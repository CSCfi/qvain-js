This directory contains the json-schema validator used in Qvain.

The code is written in ES6 (ES2015) Javascript. To test, you probably need to install babel-cli and babel-preset-env because – depending on the version – node might not understand all of the ES6 features.

$ npm install babel-cli babel-preset-env

Then, you can run the watcher:

$ ./dev.sh

... which should transpile the Javascript files from ./src to ./build.

You can then run the Javascript files in the ./build directory with node:

$ node build/index.js

If your version of node supports all ES6 functionality, such as modules, then you can simply run the code from the ./src directory directly.
